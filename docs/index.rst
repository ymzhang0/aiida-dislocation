`aiida-dislocation` is an AiiDA plugin designed to automate and manage high-throughput calculations for dislocation systems.
It provides a series of experimental workflows for calculating the unstable stacking fault energy and generalized stacking fault energy.

This plugin is built upon the powerful infrastructure of `aiida-quantumespresso` and `aiida-wannier90-workflows`.
